Getting things done in a personal flow of stress-free productivity is the best way to attain your goals with ease while having fun on the way there.
Helping people to get into that flow as well as stay within it is our main goal.
Anser is an App for OS X and IOS uniquely unifying a frame of behavioral processes into a tool helping to attain these goal. Helping you on getting things done and teaching you how to get good at it.

Current applications which are trying to help you get organised do not work for multiple reasons. One reason for that is that tasks and actions within the tool have to be in sync with your goals. Outdated junk needs to get cleaned up regularily. No open loops must stay in the system. Only a system reflecting your current priorities is a system you can trust.
Another reason is that systems fail at showing you only the immediate next actionable items. Tasks nothing can be done about will only distract your current work. Furthermore you can only trust a system which is completely transparent and open. Anser stores all data in human readable files and a folder structure. And last but not least Anser is not another task silo, Anser sits upon a known storage and keeps its structure aligned to your goals. At the beginning we manage the file system and the your Mailbox.     
Anser is a game. Helping you get organised. Showing you step by step how to enhance your individual productivity level, regardless where you currently are. Anser adapts to where you currently stand by unlocking more and more advanced feature depending on your ability to cope with the process.

We invite you to take a tour throught these features, from the simple ones to the more sophisticated, from crawling out of the egg to learing to fly:

Life of a goose
===============

Popping out of the egg (Managing a List)
----------------------

After crawling out of the egg the most important things are the small and pressing ones. Like keeping you warm under mama goose or finding your first food. Same with Anser. A new way of getting your things done hits the hard reality, the speed of your life will not slow down only because you got a new fancy tool on your IPad. So Anser deals with first things first. What is the most pressing thing you want to get organised? Your daily grocery? Whom to call when?
Create a new Task by simply adding it, have a List of Things to do.

Walking around the nest (Adding Context)
-----------------------

After some time mother gooze will take a walk around the nest and all her siblings follow her. So there is more then only the nest, so much to do at the lake, the yard, the small basture behind the farm. If there is more than a nest for our litte Anser, is there more than a single list for our digital companion?
Finding that Anser works for your grocery, why not adding your Phonecalls, Things you need to do in the garden, Things to mention next time you see your boss, whatever you think of. Structuring your tasks into a Context helps to get a filtered view on what can be done next at every specific situation. 

Making plans in a huge world (Using Tigglers)
-------------------

When walking around the nest the little gooze sees a lot of things it can do. But not right now. Taking a swim in the lake might be a good idea tomorrow. In Anser, we don't want to get disturbed by Tasks we don't have to care about currently. This not only means tasks which can't be done here (if a task is in the Context "next time I see my boss" it will make no sense to have this tasks in front of you when you sit at home at the chimney), but also tasks which can't be done now. If you have to file your report by the end of the month, you want to see that task as soon as it is possible for you to take an action about it (like writing the report and filing it). Here comes the tiggler, your private post office clerk dedicated to send letters back to you at a specific future date you decided you want to receive them. 
So with not only not seeing which can't be done right here, but also what can't be done right now, Anser keeps clean und neat, only showing you tasks you can do immedeate next actions uppon.

Finding the way back to the nest (Having one Inbox for all stuff)
----

But now you got lost, all these nice little context to but the Task into, but with every new context another decision where it goes to. But when having an idea we don't want to think about where to put it and what it implies, who needs to be involved, ..., we want to have it fast in Anser so that we can deal with that idea later on. Here comes Inbox, one single Inbox to put all your ideas and thoughts. Later on, when you go throught the Inbox,  you decide item by item, what to do with it. How to structure it, where to put it. This separation between "bring your idea fast into the system" and "decide later what to do about it" keeps you fast and complete, everything at its time. You will be suprised how many opportunities come up during the day to go throught the Inbox while waiting for a meeting, driving home from work, ....

Finding your purpose in live (Building up horizonts of focus)
--------------

First it is interesting for our little gooze to run around a bit to explore the world. But the more it runs around, the more one question comes into it's mind. "Why?". Also using Anser for task management can be a fun game by itself, but the more tasks you process the more it will come to your mind to question the reason why you are doing things. Here comes the possibility to structure your tasks. Build up horizons of focus, have a structure of projects to file the tasks into. Structuring your tasks that way also prevents open loops, if a project has no more tasks it is either completed or you find out that there is more to do.

Step back from time to time (Using Reviews)
-------------

Our little gooze has to take a step from time to time to verify that it is still on the right track. Live is a moving target. With all that structure around us it gets more and more likely, that these structures are out of date, that our live has changed meanwhile. A weekly review giving you a view from above to align your goals with your structure helps keeping up to the change.


Main features
=============

One Inbox for all your stuff
----------------------------

Anser provides one single Inbox for everthing coming in. Every possibly actionable item you have to take care of appears in your Inbox for further processing.
Keep your mind free from distractions. If something comes to your mind, dump it into the inbox so that you can forget about it for now and go on with whatever you where doing.
Also incoming Mails are put into your Inbox.
Process your Inbox like you read your facebook newsfeed. From time to time, once a while take a look and cope with the items meanwhile arrived in your inbox by deciding to trash them, do them instantly if it takes less than 2 minutes or file them for beeing done later. Believe us, nothing is so important to disturb you from your current work instead of waiting for your Inbox grooming. Complete relaxed control of your incoming workflow. 

Open structure for storing your stuff
-------------------------------------

All data is stored transparent in Anser. We use folder structures, human readable textfiles and markups like todo.txt
We use existing storing mechanisms by butting our data into a folder in your dropbox or organising your Mailbox. These way you stay independend from Anser, you can browse your project structure using any filebrowser or any mailclient. 

Keep it neat and clean
----------------------

Keeping Anser clean is essential to the success of using it. So we spend a lot of effort in supporting and helping you with that. We provide cleanup hints and tasks and encourage you to do regular reviews. To get used to Anser we start with a limited featureset, as soon as you are able to handle those more and more features are enabled. This way learning to use Anser the way it was supposted to be is fun and comes easily while working with it.

Keep your Stuff in a structure that matters for you
---------------------------------------------------

Keeping all your tasks in a structure that reflects your goals is essential to keep the intuitive overview. Anser lets you build up a structure of projects to file tasks and support material into. Anser helps you to keep that structure aligned with your shifting goals and up to date.
A Context is another dimension on every task. The Context gives a hint when, where, under what circumstances a task can be performed. This can be for example something like "at office" or "next time I meet Sally".  

Tickler
-------

A tickler is an easy way to tell Anser "show me a task again somewhen at a future date". Everything which requires your future attention but can't be done now, can be handled using a tickler. See our FAQ for more details on why ticklers are the better duedate for most situations.

Delegate your Stuff
-------------------

This feature comes in handy when a task is performed by someone else and you want to keep track of it. Use a person context (for example "Joe") to see that task in a "Waiting for" list, use a tickler to see it only as soon as you expect something to be returned by the person you delegated the task to.

All the stuff the others also do
--------------------------------

Of course you see your todo list, can search your lists by context or content, browse the history of your actions, see what needs to be done next and complete tasks. But as this is all the stuff any other todo app also does, we will not go into detail here. Simply expect the features of a todoapp :-)

Life's a game 
-------------

Anser acompanies you at getting a Pro at *getting things done*. Start simple and level up, get more and more features to handle more and more aspects of your life with anser, go on missions to train new habits and use those habits to get even more successful.

Where does your money go?
=========================

We currently have a working prototype of our App to verify the key features and how getting things done works on a digital device the way we wanted it to be. But there is still a lot to do:  
* Creating a first version including
    * stabilisation end beta testing
    * usability testing and working in feedback into the App
    * publish in app store
* Marketing   
    * Fueling our Blog and Twitter with new content about getting things done
    * setting up a homepage
* Growing Anser
    * continuous improvement on covering the ideas of getting things done with our App

What are your Milestones?
=========================

Risk an Challenges
==================

* Will the way our App uniquely approaches Getting Things Done work for more than our group of testusers? We think so, but we can't be sure. 
* We have over 10 years experience in development of software products, which might be seen as a good thing as we know what is ahead of us. It might be seen as a bad thing, as we know how most software projects keep their schedules und budget. Our calculations are profoundly based on our intense work on Anser for the last year. We have a prototype and we know our featureset very well, we now what works and what doesn't. But software is in its nature always a moving target, so we can't garantuee more than to give our best to keep our promises.
* We have an approach based on gamification and leveling up the features of Anser. The tricky thing is to make it interesting und encouraging enought to keep going while providing a consistent guideline the User can follow on mastering the art of *getting things done*. 

FAQ
===

### Why do you thing Anser will finally be an approach which works for doing *getting things done* digitaly?
We do not provide a mere technical solution to an behavioral problem. We've studied as productivity-chuncies all the applications and approaches which have come and gone over the years, always searching for a better way, always seeing the same problems and bitfalls. Anser has a complete different approach, not leaving you out there in the ocean of your evergrowing tasks drown slowly, to be honest the task management is one of the fewer important parts of Anser. Anser helps you to internalize the way of *getting things done*. Anser is your personal coach. You learn step by step why things are the way they are in Anser, why this way of organising works, what are the bitfalls and what to care about.

### What is this strange Business Model of yours?
We truly believe in helping people getting their daily stuff done so they can focus on things that matter for them. Our business model incorporates that thought, we care primary about finally providing a way to enhance stress-free productivity.

### No more Due-Date? 
*getting things done* heavily depends on tigglers, which are a kind of "sending the task at a later date back to you". Most task management tools do not provide that possibility but instead add a duedate to every task. Why is that? 
Well, most of the time we interfere with our environment using deadlines (better name it a "descrete point in time at which you have something to be completed"). So mapping a deadline to a duedate is the obvious and easy solution, but bringts a lot of distadvantages. 
* You see all the things you have to do and get frustrated even bevor starting. Like having a citchen full of dirty crockery, seeing the complete pile at once simply makes you run away instead of starting to wash the dishes.
* You mix up your hard deadlines with your softer ones (which are by far more). Showing up next Monday at 9:00 AM for your job interview is a hard deadline. But calling someone back for information you need isn't. How to disdinguish now? In a Tasklist-Tool having duedates not so easy...
We put hard deadlines in your calendar, pinning a certain non movable point in time is what it was made for.
Everything else is a "next action" which can be done as soon as possible. The problem with "as soon as possible" is a more behavioural then it is a technical. We, conditioned to deadlines, see "as soon as possible" letting it lay as long as possible to get it done just before the deadline.

So keeping your list of "next actions" as small as possible but in return commiting to doing "next actions" in a sense of "as soon as possible" (if it is not as soon as possible, you can tiggle it furhter into the future) helps you get rid of the duedate.
