# Forget it!

  If you want to free your mind, you have to forget all the stuff that triggers you.
  But really forgetting important stuff for a moment isn't easy.
  We found that's the problem with software that wants to implement David Allens GTD.
  We don't really forget the stuff. We only transfer the open loops in your head in a digital system of open loops we can't forget.

  We developed a digital implementation of GTD, we call 'Forgetting Things Done' that focus on this matter. Forgetting Things Done is a set of rules, that helps you to build one system you trust. It is an open approach you can use with the software you usual use. It uses that storage you already use like your email-services, your file system, Dropbox or Evernote. It's future proof.
  
  To forget you need one system. One system don't mean one storage, you can use the system in different storages at the same time. But gradually with more storages it would be ineffective. That's why we developed **Forget it!**. Forget it! is an app that shows you your divided system as one system. You can organize and review everything without switching your app.

  The biggest learning after our research of digital implementations of GTD was, that the most people lost the trust in their system if they lost the control. The people are overwhelmed of the complexity that grows with the time. That's why David Allen said, the review is the most important part of 'Getting Things Done'.

  We know that to forget things, we have to focus on the review. Forget it! has smart algorithms that help you to find open loops in your system. It hides files or whole folders for a specific time.

  But the best function of Forget it! is, that it adapts the complexity of your possibilities to your ability to control it. You can see it as game. You start in at a low complexity level with not much functions. If you master this level you get new functions and more possibilities. But if you are lazy you fall back to an easier level.




  





Main features
=============

One Inbox for all your stuff
----------------------------

Anser provides one single Inbox for everything coming in. Every possibly actionable item you have to take care of appears in your Inbox for further processing.
Keep your mind free from distractions. If something comes to your mind, dump it into the inbox so that you can forget about it for now and go on with whatever you where doing.
Also incoming Mails are put into your Inbox.
Process your Inbox like you read your Facebook newsfeed. From time to time, once a while take a look and cope with the items meanwhile arrived in your inbox by deciding to trash them, do them instantly if it takes less than 2 minutes or file them for beeing done later. Believe us, nothing is so important to disturb you from your current work instead of waiting for your Inbox grooming. Complete relaxed control of your incoming workflow. 

Open structure for storing your stuff
-------------------------------------

All data is stored transparent in Anser. We use folder structures, human readable textfiles and markups like todo.txt
We use existing storing mechanisms by butting our data into a folder in your dropbox or organizing your Mailbox. These way you stay independent from Anser, you can browse your project structure using any filebrowser or any mailclient. 

Keep it neat and clean
----------------------

Keeping Anser clean is essential to the success of using it. So we spend a lot of effort in supporting and helping you with that. We provide cleanup hints and tasks and encourage you to do regular reviews. To get used to Anser we start with a limited featureset, as soon as you are able to handle those more and more features are enabled. This way learning to use Anser the way it was supposed to be is fun and comes easily while working with it.

Keep your Stuff in a structure that matters for you
---------------------------------------------------

Keeping all your tasks in a structure that reflects your goals is essential to keep the intuitive overview. Anser lets you build up a structure of projects to file tasks and support material into. Anser helps you to keep that structure aligned with your shifting goals and up to date.
A Context is another dimension on every task. The Context gives a hint when, where, under what circumstances a task can be performed. This can be for example something like "at office" or "next time I meet Sally".  

Tickler
-------

A tickler is an easy way to tell Anser "show me a task again somewhen at a future date". Everything which requires your future attention but can't be done now, can be handled using a tickler. See our FAQ for more details on why ticklers are the better duedate for most situations.

Delegate your Stuff
-------------------

This feature comes in handy when a task is performed by someone else and you want to keep track of it. Use a person context (for example "Joe") to see that task in a "Waiting for" list, use a tickler to see it only as soon as you expect something to be returned by the person you delegated the task to.

All the stuff the others also do
--------------------------------

Of course you see your todo list, can search your lists by context or content, browse the history of your actions, see what needs to be done next and complete tasks. But as this is all the stuff any other todo app also does, we will not go into detail here. Simply expect the features of a todoapp :-)

Life's a game 
-------------

Anser accompanies you at getting a Pro at *getting things done*. Start simple and level up, get more and more features to handle more and more aspects of your life with anser, go on missions to train new habits and use those habits to get even more successful.

Developing software is my passion since I got my first computer in the middleages of IT around 96. Since then i got quite far like being system architect of an rfid middleware having a total development effort of over 40 manyears as well as creating a service desk and contract management software based on Microsoft SharePoint. I will be the driving force behind the technical creation of Anser. 

Where does your money go?
=========================

We currently have a working prototype of our App to verify the key features and how getting things done works on a digital device the way we wanted it to be. But there is still a lot to do:  
* Creating a first version including
    * stabilization end beta testing
    * usability testing and working in feedback into the App
    * publish in app store
* Marketing   
    * Fueling our Blog and Twitter with new content about getting things done
    * setting up a homepage
* Growing Anser
    * continuous improvement on covering the ideas of getting things done with our App

The money we are asking for will make up 50% of our initial cost to get the job done. The rest will be provided by the team, our own fundings, hard- and software, long development nights and weekends and some StartUp support from the Austrain government.  

What are your Milestones?
=========================

If this campaign succeeds, our planned schedule is as follows: 
We continue development throughout 2015 and update our backers on the progress with our bi-weekly results from the scrum review. A closed beta for our backers will be available by end of 2015 and the final release is planned for mid of 2016.

Risk an Challenges
==================

* Will the way our App uniquely approaches Getting Things Done work for more than our group of testusers? We think so, but we can't be sure. 
* We have over 10 years experience in development of software products, which might be seen as a good thing as we know what is ahead of us. It might be seen as a bad thing, as we know how most software projects keep their schedules und budget. Our calculations are profoundly based on our intense work on Anser for the last year. We have a prototype and we know our featureset very well, we now what works and what doesn't. But software is in its nature always a moving target, so we can't guarantee more than to give our best to keep our promises.
* We have an approach based on gamification and leveling up the features of Anser. The tricky thing is to make it interesting und encouraging enough to keep going while providing a consistent guideline the User can follow on mastering the art of *getting things done*. 

FAQ
===

### Why do you thing Anser will finally be an approach which works for doing *getting things done* digitally?
We do not provide a mere technical solution to an behavioral problem. We've studied as productivity-chuncies all the applications and approaches which have come and gone over the years, always searching for a better way, always seeing the same problems and bitfalls. Anser has a complete different approach, not leaving you out there in the ocean of your evergrowing tasks drown slowly, to be honest the task management is one of the fewer important parts of Anser. Anser helps you to internalize the way of *getting things done*. Anser is your personal coach. You learn step by step why things are the way they are in Anser, why this way of organizing works, what are the bitfalls and what to care about.

### What is this strange Business Model of yours?
We truly believe in helping people getting their daily stuff done so they can focus on things that matter for them. Our business model incorporates that thought, we care primary about finally providing a way to enhance stress-free productivity.

### No more Due-Date? 
*getting things done* heavily depends on ticklers, which are a kind of "sending the task at a later date back to you". Most task management tools do not provide that possibility but instead add a duedate to every task. Why is that? 
Well, most of the time we interfere with our environment using deadlines (better name it a "descrete point in time at which you have something to be completed"). So mapping a deadline to a duedate is the obvious and easy solution, but bringts a lot of distadvantages. 
* You see all the things you have to do and get frustrated even bevor starting. Like having a citchen full of dirty crockery, seeing the complete pile at once simply makes you run away instead of starting to wash the dishes.
* You mix up your hard deadlines with your softer ones (which are by far more). Showing up next Monday at 9:00 AM for your job interview is a hard deadline. But calling someone back for information you need isn't. How to distinguish now? In a Tasklist-Tool having duedates not so easy...
We put hard deadlines in your calendar, pinning a certain non movable point in time is what it was made for.
Everything else is a "next action" which can be done as soon as possible. The problem with "as soon as possible" is a more behavioral then it is a technical. We, conditioned to deadlines, see "as soon as possible" letting it lay as long as possible to get it done just before the deadline.

So keeping your list of "next actions" as small as possible but in return committing to doing "next actions" in a sense of "as soon as possible" (if it is not as soon as possible, you can tickle it further into the future) helps you get rid of the duedate. 

### Why are you funding in $ while sitting in Austria?
So far starting a kickstarter project is not possible from Austria. Also we assume that most of our backers will come from the states and we want to feel closer to our target group.
