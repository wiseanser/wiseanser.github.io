Where does your money go?
=========================

We currently have a working prototype of our App to verify the key features and how getting things done works on a digital device the way we wanted it to be. But there is still a lot to do:  
* Creating a first version including
    * stabilisation and a lot of beta testing
    * usability testing and working in feedback into the App
    * publish in app store
* Marketing   
    * Fueling our Blog and Twitter with new content about getting things done
    * setting up a homepage

Risk an Challenges
==================

* Will the way our App uniquely approaches Getting Things Done work for more than our group of testusers? We think so, but we can't be sure. 
* We have over 10 years experience in development of software products, which might be seen as a good thing as we know what is ahead of us. It might be seen as a bad thing, as we know how most software projects keep their schedules und budget. Our calculations are profoundly based on our intense work on Anser for the last year. We have a prototype and we know our featureset very well, we now what works and what doesn't. But software is in its nature always a moving target, so we can't garantuee more than to give our best to keep our promises.

FAQ
===

### Why do you thing Anser will finally be an approach which works for doing *getting things done* digitaly?
We do not provide a mere technical solution to an behavioral problem. We've studied as productivity-chuncies all the applications and approaches which have come and gone over the years, always searching for a better way, always seeing the same problems and bitfalls. Anser has a complete different approach, not leaving you out there in the ocean of your evergrowing tasks drown slowly, to be honest the task management is one of the fewer important parts of Anser. Anser helps you to internalize the way of *getting things done*. Anser is your personal coach. You learn step by step why things are the way they are in Anser, why this way of organising works, what are the bitfalls and what to care about.

### What is this strange Business Model of yours?
We truly believe in helping people getting their daily stuff done so they can focus on things that matter for them. Our business model incorporates that thought, we care primary about finally providing a way to enhance stress-free productivity.
