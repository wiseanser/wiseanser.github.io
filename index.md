We believe that a state of personal flow is attainable where stress-free productivity for getting things done is possible.
Helping people to get into that flow as well as stay within it is our main goal.
Anser is an App for IOS uniquely unifying a frame of behavioral processes into a tool helping to attain these goal. Helping you on getting things done and teaching you how to get good at it.

Live of an Anser
====================

Popping out of the egg (Managing a List)
----------------------

After crawling out of the egg the most important things are the small and pressing ones. Like keeping you warm under mama goose or finding your first food. Same with Anser. A new way of getting your things done hits the hard reality, the speed of your life will not slow down only because you got a new fancy tool on your IPad. So Anser deals with first things first. What is the most pressing thing you want to get organised? Your daily grocery? Whom to call when?
Create a new Task by simply adding it, have a List of Things to do. 

Walking around the nest (Adding Context)
-----------------------

After some time mother gooze will take a walk around the nest and all her siblings follow her. So there is more then only the nest, so much to do at the lake, the yard, the small basture behind the farm. If there is more than a nest for our litte Anser, is there more than a single list for our digital companion?
Finding that Anser works for your grocery, why not adding your Phonecalls, Things you need to do in the garden, Things to mention next time you see your boss, whatever you think of. Structuring your tasks into a Context helps to get a filtered view on what can be done next at every specific situation. 

Making plans in a huge world (Using Tigglers)
-------------------

When walking around the nest the little gooze sees a lot of things it can do. But not right now. Taking a swim in the lake might be a good idea tomorrow. In Anser, we don't want to get disturbed by Tasks we don't have to care about. This not only means tasks which can't be done here (if a task is in the Context "next time I see my boss" it will make no sense to have this tasks in front of you when you sit at home at the chimney), but also tasks which can't be done now. If you have to file your report by the end of the month, you want to see that task as soon as it is possible for you to take an action about it (like writing the report and filing it). Here comes the tiggler, your private post office clerk dedicated to send letters back to you at a specific future date you decided you want to receive them. 
So with not only not seeing which can't be done right here, but also what can't be done right now, Anser keeps clean und neat, only showing you tasks you can do immedeate next actions uppon.

Finding the way back to the nest (Having one Inbox for all stuff)
----

But now you got lost, all these nice little context to but the Task into, but with every new context another decision where it goes to. But when having an idea we don't want to think about where to put it and what it implies, who needs to be involved, ..., we want to have it fast in Anser so that we can deal with that idea later on. Here comes Inbox, one single Inbox to put all your ideas and thoughts. Later on, when you go throught the Inbox,  you decide item by item, what to do with it. How to structure it, where to put it. This separation between "bring your idea fast into the system" and "decide later what to do about it" keeps you fast and complete, everything at its time. You will be suprised how many opportunities come up during the day to go throught the Inbox while waiting for a meeting, driving home from work, ....

Finding your purpose in live (Building up horizonts of focus)
--------------

First it is interesting for our little gooze to run around a bit to explore the world. But the more it runs around, the more one question comes into it's mind. "Why?". Also using Anser for task management can be a fun game by itself, but the more tasks you process the more it will come to your mind to question the reason why you are doing things. Here comes the possibility to structure your tasks. 

Step back from time to time (Using Reviews)
-------------

Live is a moving target. With all that structure around us it gets more and more likely, that these structures are out of date, that our live has changed meanwhile. A weekly review giving you a view from above to allign your goals with your structure helps keeping up to the change.

Where does your money go?
=========================

We currently have a working prototype of our App to verify the key features and how getting things done works on a digital device the way we wanted it to be. But there is still a lot to do:  
* Creating a first version including
    * stabilisation end beta testing
    * usability testing and working in feedback into the App
    * publish in app store
* Marketing   
    * Fueling our Blog and Twitter with new content about getting things done
    * setting up a homepage
* Growing Anser
    * continuous improvement on covering the ideas of getting things done with our App

Risk an Challenges
==================

* Will the way our App uniquely approaches Getting Things Done work for more than our group of testusers? We think so, but we can't be sure. 
* We have over 10 years experience in development of software products, which might be seen as a good thing as we know what is ahead of us. It might be seen as a bad thing, as we know how most software projects keep their schedules und budget. Our calculations are profoundly based on our intense work on Anser for the last year. We have a prototype and we know our featureset very well, we now what works and what doesn't. But software is in its nature always a moving target, so we can't garantuee more than to give our best to keep our promises.
* We have an approach based on gamification and leveling up the features of Anser. The tricky thing is to make it interesting und encouraging enought to keep going while providing a consistent guideline the User can follow on mastering the art of *getting things done*. 

FAQ
===

### Why do you thing Anser will finally be an approach which works for doing *getting things done* digitaly?
We do not provide a mere technical solution to an behavioral problem. We've studied as productivity-chuncies all the applications and approaches which have come and gone over the years, always searching for a better way, always seeing the same problems and bitfalls. Anser has a complete different approach, not leaving you out there in the ocean of your evergrowing tasks drown slowly, to be honest the task management is one of the fewer important parts of Anser. Anser helps you to internalize the way of *getting things done*. Anser is your personal coach. You learn step by step why things are the way they are in Anser, why this way of organising works, what are the bitfalls and what to care about.

### What is this strange Business Model of yours?
We truly believe in helping people getting their daily stuff done so they can focus on things that matter for them. Our business model incorporates that thought, we care primary about finally providing a way to enhance stress-free productivity.

### No more Due-Date? 
*getting things done* heavily depends on tigglers, which are a kind of "sending the task at a later date back to you". Most task management tools do not provide that possibility but instead add a duedate to every task. Why is that? 
Well, most of the time we interfere with our environment using deadlines (better name it a "descrete point in time at which you have something to be completed"). So mapping a deadline to a duedate is the obvious and easy solution, but bringts a lot of distadvantages. 
* You see all the things you have to do and get frustrated even bevor starting. Like having a citchen full of dirty crockery, seeing the complete pile at once simply makes you run away instead of starting to wash the dishes.
* You mix up your hard deadlines with your softer ones (which are by far more). Showing up next Monday at 9:00 AM for your job interview is a hard deadline. But calling someone back for information you need isn't. How to disdinguish now? In a Tasklist-Tool having duedates not so easy...
We put hard deadlines in your calendar, pinning a certain non movable point in time is what it was made for.
Everything else is a "next action" which can be done as soon as possible. The problem with "as soon as possible" is a more behavioural then it is a technical. We, conditioned to deadlines, see "as soon as possible" letting it lay as long as possible to get it done just before the deadline.

So keeping your list of "next actions" as small as possible but in return commiting to doing "next actions" in a sense of "as soon as possible" (if it is not as soon as possible, you can tiggle it furhter into the future) helps you get rid of the duedate.
