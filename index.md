# Forget it!


>  In karate there is an image that’s used to define the position of perfect readiness: 
> “mind like water.” Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond. 
> How does the water respond? 
> The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input; 
> then it returns to calm. It doesn’t overreact or underreact.

If you want to free your mind, you have to forget all the stuff that triggers you. But really forgetting important stuff momentarily isn't easy. We believe this has been the problem with software aimed at implementing David Allen‘s GTD. We don't really forget the stuff. We only transfer the open loops in our heads into a digital system of open loops we can't forget.

We have developed a digital implementation of GTD focused on this issue, which we call 'Forgetting Things Done'. Forgetting Things Done is a set of rules that helps you to build one system you trust. It is an open approach you can use with the software you usually employ. It uses the storage you are already using, like your email services, your file system, Dropbox or Evernote. It's future proof.
  
To forget, you need one system. One system don't mean one storage, you can use the system in different storages at the same time. But gradually, with more storages, this would be ineffective. That's why we developed *Forget it*. *Forget it* is an app that shows you your divided system as one. You can organize and review everything without switching your app.

The biggest discovery after our research of digital implementations of GTD was that most people lost trust in their system once they lost control. People are overwhelmed of the complexity that grows with time. That's why David Allen has said that the review is the most important part of 'Getting Things Done'.

We know that to forget things, we have to focus on the review. *Forget it* has smart algorithms that help you find open loops in your system. It hides files or whole folders for a specific time.

But the best function of *Forget it* is that it adjusts the complexity of your possibilities to your ability to control it. You can see it as a game. You start in at a low complexity level with a low number of functions. If you master this level, you get new functions and more possibilities. But if you are lazy, you fall back to an easier level.

Main features
=============

One Inbox for all your stuff
----------------------------

*Forget it* provides one single inbox for everything coming in. Every possibly actionable item you have to take care of appears in your inbox for further processing. Keep your mind free from distractions. If something comes up, dump it in the inbox so that you can forget about it for now and go on with whatever you were doing. Incoming mails are also put into your inbox. Process your inbox like you read your Facebook newsfeed. From time to time, take a look and process the items arrived in your inbox by deciding to trash them, do them instantly - if it takes less than 2 minutes - or file them for later processing. Believe us, nothing is so important that it should distract you from your current work, instead of letting you find the right time for your inbox grooming. This is complete, relaxed control of your incoming workflow. 

Open structure for storing your stuff
-------------------------------------

All data is stored transparently in *Forget it*. We use folder structures, humanly readable textfiles and markups like todo.txt. We use existing storing mechanisms by putting our data into a folder in your dropbox or organizing your mailbox. In this way you stay independent from *Forget it* and you can browse your project structure using any filebrowser or mailclient. 

Keep it neat and clean
----------------------

Keeping *Forget it* clean is essential to ist successful use. So we are heavily invested in supporting and helping you with that. We provide cleanup hints and tasks and encourage you to do regular reviews. To get used to *Forget it* we start with a limited featureset; as soon as you are able to handle those, more and more features are enabled. In this way, learning to use *Forget it* appropriately is fun and comes easily while working with it.

Keep your Stuff in a structure that matters for you
---------------------------------------------------

Keeping all your tasks in a structure that reflects your goals is essential to keeping an intuitive overview. *Forget it* lets you build up a structure of projects to file tasks and support material into. *Forget it* helps you keep that structure aligned with your shifting goals and up-to-date. A context is another dimension to every task. The context gives you a hint on when, where and under which circumstances a task can be performed. This can be, for example, something like "at office" or "next time I meet Sally".  

Tickler
-------

A tickler is an easy way to tell *Forget it* to "show me a task again at some future date". Everything which requires your future attention but can't be done now can be handled using a tickler. See our FAQ for more details on why ticklers are the better due date for most situations.

Delegate your Stuff
-------------------

This feature comes in handy when a task is performed by someone else and you want to keep track of it. Use a person context (for example "Joe") to see that task in a "Waiting for" list, use a tickler to see it only as soon as you expect something to be returned by the person you delegated the task to.

All the stuff the others also do
--------------------------------

Of course you see your to-do list, you can search your lists by context or content, browse the history of your actions, see what needs to be done next and complete tasks. But as this is all stuff you will find in any other to-do app, we will not go into detail here. Simply expect the features of a to- do app :-)

Life's a game 
-------------

*Forget it* accompanies you in becoming a pro at getting things done. Start simply and level up, get more and more features to handle more and more aspects of your life with *Forget it*. Go on missions to train new habits and use those habits to become even more successful. 

About us

Developing software has been my passion since I got my first computer in the middle ages of IT around `96. Since then I have gotten quite far; I am a system architect of an rfid middleware, with a total development effort of over 40 manyears, and have created a service desk and contract management software based on Microsoft SharePoint. I will be the driving force behind the technical creation of *Forget it*.

Where does your money go?
=========================

We currently have a working prototype of our app to verify the key features and to show how getting things done works on a digital device the way we want it to be. But there is still a lot to do:
* Creating a first version including
    * stabilization and beta testing
    * usability testing and working in feedback into the App
    * publishing in app store
* Marketing   
    * fueling our Blog and Twitter with new content about getting things done
    * running our homepage
    * financing SEO and campaigns 
* Growing *Forget it*
    * continuous improvement on covering the ideas of getting things done with our app

The money we are asking for will make up for 50 % of our initial cost to get the job done. The rest will be provided by the team, our own funding, hard- and software, long development nights and weekends and some startup support from the Austrian government.

What are your Milestones?
=========================

If this campaign succeeds, our planned schedule is as follows: We will continue development throughout 2015 and update our backers on the progress with our bi-weekly results from the scrum review. A closed beta for our backers will be available by the end of 2015 and the final release is planned for mid-2016.

Risk an Challenges
==================

* Will the way our app uniquely approaches Getting Things Done work for people beyond our group of test users? We think so, but we can't be sure.
* We look back on more than 10 years of experience in development of software products, which serves us well as we know what lies ahead. The downside of our experience might be that we know how most software projects keep their schedules und budget. Our calculations are profoundly based on our intense work on *Forget it* throughout last year. We have a prototype and we know our featureset very well, we know what works and what doesn't. But software by its nature is always a moving target, so we can't guarantee more than giving our best to keep our promises.
* We have an approach based on gamification and leveling up the features of *Forget it*. The tricky thing is to make it interesting und encouraging enough to keep going while providing a consistent guideline the user can follow to master the art of getting things done.

FAQ
===

### Why do you think *Forget it* will finally be an approach which works for doing getting things done digitally?
We do not provide a mere technical solution to an behavioral problem. We as productivity-junkies have studied all the applications and approaches which have come and gone over the years, always searching for a better way, always seeing the same problems and pitfalls. *Forget it* has a completely different approach, not leaving you out there in the ocean of your evergrowing tasks to drown slowly. To be honest, the task management is one of the less important parts of *Forget it*. *Forget it* helps you internalize the way of getting things done. *Forget it* is your personal coach. You learn step by step why things are the way they are in *Forget it*, why this way of organizing works, what the pitfalls are and what to care about.

### What is this strange business model of yours?
We truly believe in helping people getting their daily stuff done so they can focus on things that matter to them. Our business model incorporates that thought, we primarily care about ultimately providing a way to enhance stress-free productivity.

### No more Due-Date? 
Getting things done heavily depends on ticklers, which are a kind of "sending the task back to you at a later date". Most task management tools do not provide that possibility but instead add a due date to every task. Why is that? Well, most of the time we interfere with our environment using deadlines (better name it a "discreet point in time at which you have to complete something"). So mapping a deadline to a due date is the obvious and easy solution, but brings a lot of disadvantages.
* You see all the things you have to do and get frustrated before even starting. Like with a kitchen full of unwashed dishes, seeing the complete pile at once simply makes you run away instead of starting to wash up.
* You mix up your hard deadlines with your softer ones (which outweigh the hard ones by far). Showing up next Monday at 9 am for your job interview is a hard deadline. But calling someone back for information you need isn't. How to distinguish the two? In a tasklist tool, having due dates is not so easy... We put hard deadlines in your calendar, pinning a certain non-movable point in time is what it was made for. Everything else is a "next action" which can be done as soon as possible. The problem with "as soon as possible" is more behavioral then it is technical. Conditioned to deadlines, we interpret "as soon as possible" by pushing something up as long as possible and getting it done just before the deadline.

So keeping your list of "next actions" as small as possible but in return committing to doing "next actions" in a sense of "as soon as possible" (if it is not as soon as possible, you can tickle it further into the future) helps you get rid of the duedate. 

### Why are you funding in $ while located in Austria?
Starting a Kickstarter project is currently not possible from Austria. Also, we assume that most of our backers will come from the United States and we want to feel closer to our target group.
